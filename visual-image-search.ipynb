    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build the core components of a visual image search application. Visual image search is used in interfaces where instead of asking for something by voice or text, you show a photographic example of what you are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the core components of visual image search is a convolutional neural net (CNN) model that generates “feature vectors” representing both a query image and the reference item images to be compared against the query. The reference item feature vectors typically are generated offline and must be stored in a database of some sort, so they can be efficiently searched. For small reference item datasets, it is possible to use a brute force search that compares the query against every reference item. However, this is not feasible for large data sets where brute force search would become prohibitively slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable efficient searches for visually similar images, we'll use Amazon SageMaker to generate “feature vectors” from images and use KNN algorithm in Amazon Elasticsearch Service. KNN for Amazon Elasticsearch Service lets you search for points in a vector space and find the \"nearest neighbors\" for those points by Euclidean distance or cosine similarity(default is Euclidean distance). Use cases include recommendations (for example, an \"other songs you might like\" feature in a music application), image recognition, and fraud detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps we'll follow to build the visual image search: After some initial setup, we'll prepare a model using TensorFlow for generating feature vectors, then generate feature vectors of Fashion Images from _**feidegger**_, a _**zalandoresearch**_ dataset. Those feature vectors will be imported in Amazon Elasticsearch KNN Index. Next, we'll explore some test image queries, and visualize the results.\n"
